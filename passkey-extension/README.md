# Passkey Manager Chrome Extension

This experimental Chrome Extension helps you create, store, and use **passkeys** (WebAuthn credentials) on any website for testing and demonstration purposes.

> ⚠️ **Security Notice:** Passkeys generated by this extension are _software-based_ and stored in your browser's local extension storage. They are **NOT** protected by secure hardware or synced to your Google account the way built-in browser passkeys are. Use only for educational / development scenarios, **never** for production accounts.

## Features

* 📋 List resident passkeys stored by the extension
* ➕ Create a new passkey for the current site (resident key)
* 🔑 Request an assertion (login) using a stored passkey
* 🗑️ Delete a passkey you no longer need

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open **chrome://extensions** in Chrome and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `passkey-extension` folder.
4. The *Passkey Manager* icon should appear in the toolbar.

## Usage

1. Navigate to a website you control (or a demo site) that supports passkeys / WebAuthn.
2. Click the extension icon – the popup lists any passkeys for the current domain.
3. **Create Passkey for This Site** will prompt a WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create` call via the content script. On success the new credential is stored locally.
4. **Login** next to a passkey calls `navigator.credentials.get` with that credential’s ID. The resulting assertion is returned to the page; many demo sites will automatically complete the login if an assertion is available.
5. **✕** removes a passkey from local storage.

### Limits

* Only resident credentials (so-called *discoverable passkeys*) are supported.
* The private key material lives in JavaScript memory, so treat the extension as insecure.
* The extension cannot read or manage passkeys stored by Chrome itself or other authenticators.

## Development

* `manifest.json` – extension configuration (Manifest V3).
* `background.js` – service worker handling storage and messages.
* `contentScript.js` – injected into every page to run WebAuthn APIs.
* `popup.html`/`popup.js` – user interface.

Feel free to hack on it and adapt to your needs!
